### What I Do

I embed with customer teams to ship production AI systems — RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and ML platforms — in regulated industries where compliance, reliability, and measurable outcomes matter.

**15+ years** in healthcare, pharma, and enterprise AI:
- **Pfizer** — RAG-based knowledge platform (Azure ML, AKS, Cognitive Search)
- **Abbott Labs** — ML pipeline migration with zero FDA audit findings
- **IPG Health** — $51M portfolio across 13 pharma brands, 99.9% uptime
